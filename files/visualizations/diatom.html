<b>Description:</b><br>
Polar representation of dates, where each dot is a unique day-month-year combination. The radius reflects the year, having 1750 at the center and the current year at the perimeter, and clockwise angle from vertical shows the day-of year. Color represents number of records falling on that point over a cold-hot binary scale, being dark blue equal to 1 or 2 records and brown representing more than 2048 records. This plot is useful as a summary of all temporal patterns.
