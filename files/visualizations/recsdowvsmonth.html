<b>Type:</b> Hebdoplot<p>
<b>Applies to:</b> Publisher and collection<p>
<b>Interactive:</b> Yes<p>
<b>Description:</b><br>
Record density table, where each cell is a unique combination of weekday-month, and cell value is the total amount of records falling in that day. The greener a cell is, the more records that fall in that day. This plot is useful for detecting seasonal patterns and/or weekly biases (such as weekend scientists). By selecting the "content" of the cells, actual values are shown.
