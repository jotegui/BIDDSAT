<h3>General information and completion values</h3>
<b>Type:</b> Raw data, completion plots if only publisher is selected<p>
<b>Applies to:</b> Publisher and collection<p>
<b>Interactive:</b> Yes<p>
<b>Description:</b><br>
This dashboard shows general volume data such as number of collections, total number of records, volume of records with coordinates, declared country, year, complete date, kingdom, full taxonomic description and type of record. If no collection is selected, completion plots like the one shown here are created. These plots can give clues on the improvement potential of the publisher: publishers with all their collections half-complete (columns in the middle-ish of the X axis) are easier to improve than publishers with both full and "empty" collections (highest columns in both ends of the X axis), even if the amount of incomplete records is the same.
